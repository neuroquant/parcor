Here we have implemented a partial correlation estimation toolbox coupled with population inference for network metrics applied to partial correlation networks.

To make a record of a data analysis run on sumatra

```
smt configure -m pymat_run_main.py -e python --datapath ./Data --archive ./archive --input .
smt run -l "trial_xxx" -r "Test feature Y.2"

```




## Updates

Update June 23-2016:
- KGGMScript no longer a submodule.
- Master branch updated with network metrics
- add_network_metrics will be deleted in the future, as it has been merged.

Update June 07-2016:
Note: Although there is a submodule KGGMScript, it is currently unnecessary to use.
